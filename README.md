Ingress Logos
=============

This repository is simply a place for me to share the vector images that I've made based on Google's alternate reality game, __Ingress__.

These logos are copyrighted by Google, and are shared here for promotional purposes only. I've seen too many websites using low-res images and one or two fan made, low quality logos over and over again... Just do me a favor and use these.
